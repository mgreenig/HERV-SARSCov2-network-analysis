# Network analysis of HERVs in SARS-Cov2 and Influenza A

This repository contains a pipeline that performs a gene network analysis on an RNA-sequencing data set published by 
[Blanco-Melo et al (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742030489X) to investigate the expression
patterns of retroelements during SARS-Cov2 and Influenza A infections. We generate a HERVs transcript count data set by applying 
[Telescope](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006453) to the raw read data generated 
by Blanco-Melo and colleagues. Clusters of HERV/human genes are generated by applying hierarchical clustering with a 
[dynamic tree cut](https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/BranchCutting/).
